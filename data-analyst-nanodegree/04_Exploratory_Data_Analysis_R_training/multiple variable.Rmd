# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

# Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create
# four bins or cohorts of users.
