# Work done for the OpenStreetMap Project of the udacity data analyst nanodegree.

A samlpe XML dataset is contained in the data folder. It is a sample of the dataset used during the Project at the end of 2016. It should not be considered good data and won't be updated. That Project was done using Python and SQLite3. The Report document is a markdown version of the produced document. The Script subfolder contains the script used during the different parts of the process.
